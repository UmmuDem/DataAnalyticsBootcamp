       "'Meditation: A way to achieve your goals in your life Duck-Joo Lee Beginner Level Arts and Humanities Philosophy Do we truly think that we have lived for ourselves? Perhaps we have lived for money, love, fame, family and pride etc.? Therefore, we don’t seem to be satisfied even though we are full of those things. It is because that we don’t know ourselves.Eric Fromm talked about human nature as two modes of being: “To Have” and “To Be”.  If we are “Having” the nature of possessions, we are not satisfied, and feel empty and futile. Then, how can we be “Being” the nature of our inner-selves?\\n\\nSometimes, we happened to be aware of this “Being” nature and try to change ourselves, but fail. But, because of our daily routines, it’s easily forgotten. And more it is hard to escape from our unwanted minds controlling us.\\n\\nFrom now on, let us reflect on ourselves and look at our minds leading up to today! Don’t we achieve our goals after knowing ourselves? And let us find the “Being” nature of our original selves after escaping from the minds restraining and controlling us.\\n\\nIn this lecture, the definition and principle of the mind are explained in simple and clear ways. You can make sure and practice the methodology of finding the true original mind of inner-self by escaping from the false mind of possession. \\n\\nSelf-reflection is the first step to meditate. You can know yourselves most objectively through meditation and you will realize that all the thoughts and actions are due to your minds which are nonexistent and false. If you throw away the false mind, you will find the true mind.\\n\\nMeditation is now world-wide sensation. There are many research reports that show people can be leaders if you have a habit of self-reflection through meditation. Now meditation at school and the workplace are popular.\\n\\nHappiness is having no worries. You can really relax yourself if there is no bundle of thoughts and you can be successful when you know yourself truly. Worries come from the memorized thoughts of the false mind. Your inner potential of positive power are revealed, your peaceful and happiest mind will be in your mind, and you can live the life you wanted through meditation.\\n\\nThis method of meditation is very practical and everybody can follow the methodology. As an engineer, I will guide you step by step to practice this meditation. I am sure that this lecture becomes a turning point in your life.[\\'Self- reflection is the methodology of meditation for growth, happiness and human completion: (1) Why do we need self-reflection?, (2) Academic research on self-reflection, (3) Draw my life graph, and (4) Ultimate purpose of self-reflection\\', \\'Learn the principle of self-reflection and practice the self–reflection through 5 subjects: \\', \\'(1) Methodology of self-reflection, (2) Practice of self-reflection through 5 essential subjects (barrier in relationships, inferiority and ego in childhood, emotion of love and hatred since childhood, worries, response to problems), and (3) My past life and my current self\\', \\'Recognize the copied world and real world and think of living free from the self.: (1) Principle of mind formation, (2) Human recognition observed by philosophers and neuroscientists, (3) Understanding the reasons why we cannot live my own way, and (4) Human mind and Original mind\\', \\'Learn and practice the methodology of mind cleansing: (1) Do you want to change yourself?, (2) Methodology of the mind cleansing, (3) Repetition of the self-reflection of the 5 essential subjects, (4) Real potential and positive mind.\\', \\'Learn and practice the methodology of self-reflection and the mind cleansing in everyday life: (1)Stress is the impetus for growth, (2) Case study on overcoming the self, (3) Health-mind relationship and brain wave changes, and (4) Meaning of self-reflection and the mind cleansing in life.\\', \\'Let’s start the peaceful life with wisdom: (1) Draw your life graph again, (2)People at school and the office practicing self-reflection continuously, (3) Meaning of self-reflection in social aspects (through reflections on communication and relationships), (4) Starting point of the peaceful life with wisdom\\', \\'Introduction\\', \\'1-1.
