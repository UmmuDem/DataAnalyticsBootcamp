# Order of notebooks 
I prefered working step by step on different jupyter notebooks so I may extend this project later.
- First you can start what I did with spotify api. 
[Here](https://github.com/UmmuDem/Ummuhan/blob/main/Week%207/Labs/Spotify%20project/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Spotify_audio_features.ipynb).
  * I chose four playlists, and got all artists and then all songs of those artists. I created dataframes from them and cleaned them up.
  * Then I got audio features and extracted all dataframes.
- Second, all data were merged [here](https://github.com/UmmuDem/Ummuhan/blob/main/Week%207/Labs/Spotify%20project/Jupyter%20Notebooks/all_data.ipynb).
  * Just dropped dublicates.
- Third, clustering and optimal Kmeans analysis were held in [here](https://github.com/UmmuDem/Ummuhan/blob/main/Week%207/Labs/Spotify%20project/Jupyter%20Notebooks/Clustering.ipynb).
- [This](https://github.com/UmmuDem/Ummuhan/blob/main/Week%207/Labs/Spotify%20project/Jupyter%20Notebooks/billboard-recommender.ipynb) is the 1st prototype.
